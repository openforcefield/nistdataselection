This folder contains all of the inputs (and the scripts used to generate them) and outputs of performing force field 
optimizations on only pure properties. 

In particular, the:
  
* ``data_set_generation`` folder contains the scripts used to build the training set.

* ``force_balance`` folder contains the inputs and outputs of ``ForceBalance`` for each sub-study.
  
* ``benchmarking`` folder contains results of benchmarking the optimized force field against the test set 
  constructed in ``../benchmark_selection``.
